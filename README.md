German Whips

My final milestone project is based on selling german cars and browsing through reviews about the newest german cars.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.

UX

Below I have listed the user stories for my final milestone project.

As a new user, I would like the site to be easy to use.

As a user, I would like to browse, search and sort through the different types of german cars.

As a user, I want to be able to see an image of the cars for sale and information about the cars history such as mileage and year.

As a user, I also want to be able to store cars for sale that I wish to buy to a wishlist in my account.

As a user, I would like to be able to purchase the german car I am interested in.

As a user, I would like to register an account so the my purchases and delivery information is retained for future use.

As a user, I would like to be able to read reviews about the newest german cars.

As a user, I would like to be able to sort and sort through the reviews.

As a user, I would like to navigate and select the german brand which I am interested in and read reviews about.

As a user, I would like to be able to easily contact the site and would like different ways to.

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
