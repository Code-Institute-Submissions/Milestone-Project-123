Strategy
My strategy was to create a site where users can purchase and read reviews about german cars.

Scope
The site will be for users interested in german cars which are considered the best in the world. 
The user will be able to create an account to view their purchases, save their delivery information, purchase cars or add them to their own wishlist. 
They can also read reviews about the latest german cars as well.

Structure
The site's layout is as follows:
The navbar is broken down into two sections, in the top navbar is the logo, a search box and the 'My Account' link to a dropdown of its functions. In the second navbar will be the links for browsing through the main pages of the site like 'Browse Cars' and 'Car Reviews' which when clicked will provide a dropdown of links of the german brands, 'Home' and 'Contact Us' links are also in this navbar, in between the navbars is a delvery banner.
When the user clicks on the my account icon a dropdown will appear with two links 'Register' and 'Login' and when they have logged in there will three links 'My Account', 'Wishlist' and 'Logout'. If a store owner logged in, they will see two additional links 'Car Management' and 'Review Management'. 
The home page will display a background image and some text with a 'Browse Now' button.
On the 'All Cars' page, all the cars for sale will displayed. Here the user can see all the german cars for sale, on the left will be a listing count and on the right will be a sort dropdown. If the user clicked on the 'Browse Cars' in the navbar and in the dropdown clicked on one of the following links 'Volkwagen', 'BMW', 'Audi' or 'Mercedes-Benz' it will take the user to that brand page with the cars listed for that particular brand. The layout of each listing on these pages are done in a card format, there will be border around the card, an image of the car will take up the top half of the card and the bottom half will be the car's make, model, year and price with a tag of the brand.
On the 'All Reviews' page, all the reviews will displayed. Here the user can see all the german car reviews, there will be a review search box and below on the left will be a review count and on the right will be a sort dropdown. If the user clicked on the 'Car Reviews' in the navbar and in the dropdown clicked on one of the following links 'Volkwagen Reviews', 'BMW Reviews', 'Audi Reviews' or 'Mercedes-Benz Reviews' it will take the user to that brand page with the reviews listed for that particular brand. The layout of each review on these pages are done in a card format, there will be border around the card, an image of the car will take up the top half of the card and the bottom half will be the car's make, model, year and who completed the review with a tag of the brand.
When the store owner is on any of these pages for cars and reviews, at the bottom of each card there will be edit and delete links.
On a single listings page, on the left they will see a bigger image of the car and on the right will be more information on the car such as the mileage, fuel type and transmission and the car's information. Below this will be two buttons 'Buy Now' and 'Wishlist'.
on a single review page, on the left they will see a bigger image of the car and on the right will be a advantage and disadvantage of the car being reviewed and below this will be the review of the car.
When on either a single listing or review, there will be a edit and delete links that a store owner can see and use, which will be below the disadvantage section.
On the purchase page, on the the left will be the purchase form with the payment method at the bottom and on the right will be a small purchase summary.
When the purchase is complete, it will display the order summary for the user with the order number included in this.
The 'My Account' page will display a default delivery information form on the left and on the right their order history.
On the 'Wishlist' page, when a car is added it will be in a row, with a small image being first from the left then the car infomation, then the price of the car and two buttons.
On the 'Contact Us' page, it will display a collapsible with three blocks 'By Phone', 'By Email' and 'By Post'.

Skeleton

Surface
The colors that are used in the website are black and white with white being the dominant background color except in the delivery row and black being the dominant color of most of the text apart from the delivery row and text on the home page. I stuck with this colors as I think it gave the site a professional and efficient look and these are want german car are known for. The font that was used for the site was Gayathri, this was used as it was a professional style and was easily readable. The background image on the home page is of salesman shaking hands with a man and handing over car keys after completing a deal, this image was used as enticement for users to complete a deal to get a german car.

Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
